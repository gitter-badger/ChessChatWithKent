Oi! Kent!

Hi John!
I'm watching on chess24
My prediction of the Aronian game might prove correct - it certainly seems the most interesting.

Hey, hey, hey! I've got chess24 on the go too, but also the live YouTube stream from Saint Louis! And yes, you seem to one up at the moment. But it's early days... :)

I'll give the St Louis stream a go too! The Car vs Car game has become quite unbalanced now :)

WAT?!
